# Why Julia
This repository should contain notes on the Julia language, from which we can incrementally make the argument for using Julia in academic and industry environment.

## Contents
- `general_notes.md` - assortment of notes on different aspects of Julia and how to approach the presentation
- `CJP_comparison.md` - comparison between C, Python and Julia implementation of some tasks
- `julia_snippets.md` - interesting snippets of code, that show something worth pointing out in the language
- `pkg_tooling.md` - write up about the capabilities of the Pkg3 tool
- `python_comparison.md` - notes about the difference between Julia and Python
- `science_motivation.md` - summarization of what scientists generally need from a programming language and where Julia can help them
- `speed_and_uncertainty.md` - about the notion of that speed penalty is correlated with the uncertainty about the code
- `sources_references.md` - list of interesting articles, videos, discussions and other sources
- `whyjulia.ipynb` - initial presentation given on CS seminar on 14th March 2019

## Rules for adding content
- when you find something interesting, add it to `sources_references.md` and describe in few notes the content there, 
- if there is more to be written about the newly found source and falls into some of the current categories currently represented as the markdown files here add some notes there
- otherwise create a new markdown

We will be more than happy if there are any additions at all, so don't mind the rules that much and just add it wherever you want, as the structure is not yet settled.
